                         <div class="shoutout"><img src="images/presenters/jim-cowart.png" style="height: 150px; width: 150px;"><br/>We are very excited to have Jim Cowart with us to officially launch NoogaJS as our first presenter! <i>(No Pressure Jim)</i><br/><br/>
                        Jim Cowart is a web developer, tragically geeky about JavaScript, HTML5, open source, hybrid mobile development...but he's not a fan of lists, so we'll stop there. Having journeyed through Cold Fusion, an obscure proprietary JavaScript BI implementation, C#, a smidgeon of Erlang and even spent some time as a data warehouse architect and developer. <br/><br/>
                        He's most passionate about connecting with other developers â€“ learning, sharing and promoting patterns and ideas that will make development more productive, enjoyable and empowering. <br/><br/>Jim lives in Chattanooga with his wife and two sons.  He works for Telerik as a Developer Advocate for Icenium, and you can follow him on twitter - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ifandelse" target="_blank">@ifandelse<a>.
