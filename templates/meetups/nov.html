David is a software developer living, working, and playing in Cleveland Tennessee who just earlier this year was in New York City to claim one of the most respected awards in the Internet and web-development world â€” a Webby Award.

                        &quot;Imagine a group of co-workers sitting down at a conference table for a meeting. Each employee has an iPad. With this platform, those employees can instantly share data just by flicking a finger in the right direction and sliding a virtual photo, report or blueprint across the table. And when the meeting ends, each employee can take that information back to his desk.&quot; <br/><br/> 
                        As the director of research and development at Universal Mind, a digital solutions agency that specializes in creating apps that allow for a multiscreen customer experience, David spearheaded the company's effort to create the iPad Table. It's a table top made of 15 iPads -- and they function as one device.<br/><br/>
                        David is the Director of Research and Development and iOS Practice Manager at Universal Mind, and you can follow him on twitter - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mindmillmedia" target="_blank">@mindmillmedia</a>.
